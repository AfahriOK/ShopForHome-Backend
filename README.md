# Reflections

I had some experience working with Spring but this project greatly increased my knowledge. I did not know exactly how to use Spring security at first so that was my biggest challenge in this project since I also wanted to implement JSON Web Tokens(JWT). I gained experience in  designing and using a MySQL database and Spring Data JPA for object persistence. I used Postman to test my endpoints and gained A LOT of experience debugging my code.
